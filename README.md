   _(continue to be updated)_
   
   💡 **Skills**: Using SQL in Danny's Complete 8-Week SQL Challenges, I extracted, cleaned, and transformed data for analysis. I utilized joins, CTEs, window functions, and aggregate queries to explore and manipulate datasets. Throughout this process, I performed data preprocessing, optimized query performance, and ensured data integrity.


🌻 **Python Web Utilities**
- [Palindrome Checker](https://github.com/hienmoon1017/python-palindrome-checker)
- [A Webpage Timer Function](https://github.com/hienmoon1017/python-webpage-timer-function)

  💡 **Skills**: Using while loops and if-else statements to create utilities.


🌻 **Data Analysis with Python**
- [Using Python for Data Analytics on the Insurance Charges Dataset](https://github.com/hienmoon1017/python-insurance-charges-dataset)
- [Analyze and Predict Housing Prices by Using Python](https://github.com/hienmoon1017/python-housing-prices)

  💡 **Skills**: Using libraries such as _Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Seaborn_, and _Matplotlib_, I clean data, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), develop single-variable and multi-variable linear regression models for prediction, and apply Ridge regression to enhance the performance of the linear regression models.


Thank you for stopping by, and I'm pleased to connect with you, my new friend!
