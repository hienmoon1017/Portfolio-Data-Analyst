   üí° **Skills**: Using SQL in Danny's Complete 8-Week SQL Challenges, I extracted, cleaned, and transformed data for analysis. I utilized joins, CTEs, window functions, and aggregate queries to explore and manipulate datasets. Throughout this process, I performed data preprocessing, optimized query performance, and ensured data integrity.
